# IHaskell-Widgets

This package implements the [ipython widgets](https://github.com/ipython/ipywidgets) in
IHaskell. The frontend (javascript) is provided by the jupyter/ipython notebook environment, whereas
the backend is implemented in haskell.

To know more about the widget messaging protocol, see [MsgSpec.md](MsgSpec.md).
